This is because despite the Conversatives and New\n            Democrats (NDP) picking up a few seats, Montreal and Toronto remain\n            Liberal strongholds. Meanwhile the popularity of the Bloc Québécois\n            (BQ) remains relatively unchanged since the last election. The Green\n            party (GPC) has made minor gains while the People's party (PPC) has\n            been losing votes to the Conservatives for months.\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"partyMargins\">\n          <iframe\n            width=\"600\"\n            height=\"371\"\n            seamless\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            scrolling=\"no\"\n            src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSHdxj1KPFMHP5gT1ybNfd_-N_7QikiUQ1zMKJgGb4xZjwPY4DcRE6xjWHlWqgbhawjk8ZO6I52MakV/pubchart?oid=1285493608&amp;format=interactive\"\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"smallTitle textBox\">2021 election results</div>\n      <div class=\"seatRow\">\n        <SeatProjection\n          v-for=\"index of indexCount\"\n          :electionValue=\"previousElection[index]\"\n          :electionParty=\"electionParties[index]\"\n          :difference=\"nextElection[index] - previousElection[index]\"\n          :currentView=\"currentView\"\n          :flip=\"true\"\n          :key=\"index\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"seatRow\">\n        <SeatProjection\n          v-for=\"index of indexCount\"\n          :electionValue=\"nextElection[index]\"\n          :electionParty=\"electionParties[index]\"\n          :difference=\"nextElection[index] - previousElection[index]\"\n          :currentView=\"currentView\"\n          :flip=\"false\"\n          :key=\"index\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"smallTitle textBox\">Current seat projections</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport SeatProjection from \"../components/SeatProjection.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"ForecastGraph\",\n  components: {\n    SeatProjection,\n  },\n  props: {\n    currentView: String,\n  },\n  data() {\n    const electionParties = [\"LPC\", \"CPC\", \"NDP\", \"BQ\", \"GPC\"];\n    const previousElection = [160, 119, 25, 32, 2];\n    const nextElection = [148, 128, 28, 31, 3];\n    const indexCount = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n    return {\n      electionParties: electionParties,\n      previousElection: previousElection,\n      nextElection: nextElection,\n      indexCount: indexCount,\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {},\n};\n</script>\n<style>\n.forecastGrid {\n  display: flex;\n}\n.partyMargins {\n  width: 620px;\n}\n.textBox {\n  padding: 5px 20px;\n  text-align: left;\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n.smallTitle {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 20px;\n  padding-top: 15px;\n}\n.seatRow {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n}\n</style>\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
