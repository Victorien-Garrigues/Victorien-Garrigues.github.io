This is because despite the Conversatives and New\n            Democrats (NDP) picking up a few seats, Montreal and Toronto remain\n            Liberal strongholds. Meanwhile the popularity of the Bloc Québécois\n            (BQ) remains relatively unchanged since the last election. The Green\n            party (GPC) has made minor gains while the People's party (PPC) has\n            been losing votes to the Conservatives for months.\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"partyMargins\">\n          <iframe\n            width=\"600\"\n            height=\"371\"\n            seamless\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            scrolling=\"no\"\n            src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSHdxj1KPFMHP5gT1ybNfd_-N_7QikiUQ1zMKJgGb4xZjwPY4DcRE6xjWHlWqgbhawjk8ZO6I52MakV/pubchart?oid=1285493608&amp;format=interactive\"\n          ></iframe>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div v-for=\"electionValue of previousElection\" :key=\"electionValue\">\n        {{ electionValue }}\n        <SeatProjection :electionValue=\"electionValue\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport SeatProjection from \"../components/SeatProjection.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"ForecastGraph\",\n  components: {\n    SeatProjection,\n  },\n  props: {},\n  data() {\n    const electionParties = [\"LPC\", \"CPC\", \"NDP\", \"BQ\", \"GPC\"];\n    const previousElection = [160, 119, 25, 32, 2];\n    const nextElection = [148, 128, 28, 31, 3];\n\n    return {\n      electionParties: electionParties,\n      previousElection: previousElection,\n      nextElection: nextElection,\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {},\n};\n</script>\n<style>\n.forecastGrid {\n  display: flex;\n}\n.partyMargins {\n  width: 620px;\n}\n.textBox {\n  padding: 5px 20px;\n  text-align: left;\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n.smallTitle {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 20px;\n  padding-top: 15px;\n}\n</style>\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
