            <p class="teamText">The purpose of the McGill XR club is to foster a community within McGill to learn, experience, and share resources around extended reality (XR), including augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR, and MR respectively). The goal of the McGill XR Committee will be to regularly meet to organize and plan events for the McGill XR club, while overseeing the management of any equipment or resources the club acquires. The hope is that we as an organization can connect McGill students with local XR events in Montreal including museums, festivals, and other venues. Moreover, we hope to bridge the gap between the immersive media industry insiders and McGill students.</p>
            <p class="teamText">The McGill XR club is well positioned for this kind of work given the vibrant commercial extended reality scene in Montreal, encompassing a multitude of technology companies, art studios, and exhibition venues dedicated to the genre. Our club will actively promote XR related events to the McGill student body to raise awareness of how extended reality is gradually becoming mainstream. McGill XR will seek to provide an informative platform for interested participants to explore the technologies, artworks, philosophies, and challenges of this new evolution in the technology space. To do so, we will form partnerships with local institutions and companies to provide curated group activities and reduced entry costs to XR events and exhibitions.</p>
            <p class="teamText">While VR gaming is obviously a big part of the current XR environment, McGill XR will allocate resources in a manner to afford additional visibility to less prominent media to provide a diversified view of the entire extended reality space.</p>
