    <h3> Kenya Camping</h3>
      <img src="image/kenyass.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:470px;height:470px;">
      <p></p>

    <p> A night in the wild at the famous Mount Ololokwe, an early 5 AM wake up call with sounds of wild beasts and the warm sun on your skin, that’s typical for campers in Kenya.
      After a delicous breakfast, the small group of 4 people got onto a jeep and drove for a while under the bright sun to one of the near villages that the guide knew.
In the village, the group was greeted by many enthusiastic locals who offered them food and refreshments, after a short rest the group got to work, helping the villagers build new houses and prepare the food for the next meal.

    <h3>Peru Expedition</h3>
    <img src="image/peruReal.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:470px;height:470px;">
      <p></p>
    <p>15 people trekked up the Andes Mountain to Machu Picchu where they walked to the Inca Bridge, the beautifully carved stone path leads to… a 20 foot drop, which our thrill-seeking travelers crossed with the aid of some sturdy tree trunks.
Then they just walked around the village, taking in the various sights; the temple of the three windows, the fountains, the central plaza, the sacred rock… All the while their guide gave them detailed information about the beliefs and history of this gorgeous place.
By the end of the day, feet were aching but memories were made.

    <h3>Nepal Trip</h3>
    <img src="image/nepalReal.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:470px;height:470px;">
      <p></p>
    <p>A trip to the historical Madhyapur Thimi really let’s young travelers absorb the beauty and history of Nepal. Situated in higher altitudes, the group set up early in the morning and left their campsite to hike up to the city of Madhyapur Thimi.
Once there they in the city, they were able to catch a beautiful view of the sunrise and the images of the city slowly coming to life. People hurrying to work and to the culturally significant temple.
A walk through the city really shows the hidden gems of Nepal and our group stopped at a small local shop for a local breakfast made up of chai.

    <h3>Myanmar Boatride</h3>
    <img src="image/myanmar.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:470px;height:470px;">
      <p></p>
    <p>The glittering Inle lake laid quiet as 8 YOI bucket listers took a boat trip from one side to the other of the lake. The quietness was relaxing and the sound of the wooden boat crashing into the slight waves in the water relaxed the group so much so that some even fell asleep!
Then the group visited some floating farms and walked upon some floating plantations. One of them fell when someone tried jumping up and down to see what would happen. And they had to rush to their accommodations (a local house) to quickly change into warmer (and dryer!) clothes.
